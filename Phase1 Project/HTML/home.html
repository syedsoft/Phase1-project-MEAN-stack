When to Go to India<br>
When planning a visit to India, note that the monsoon season typically runs from June to November, depending on the region. The best time to visit India is from November until April, before the heat sets in. 
If you're visiting India during the summer or monsoon seasons, the far north, the "hill station" vacation towns, or the coast offer the most relief from the heat.
