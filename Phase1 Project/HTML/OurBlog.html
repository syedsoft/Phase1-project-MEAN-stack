    <P style="font-style: italic; font-size: x-large;">
        An award-winning journalist for 34 years, Claudia Carbone is a native of Denver, Colorado where she still lives. Throughout her world travels, 
        she’s come to realize that the places you sleep at night can be just as 
        memorable as places you visit during the day. She’s slept in a treehouse on Orcas Island, a yurt in the Rocky Mountains, and an ice hotel in Quebec. 
        In Sleepin’ Around – A Hotel and Travel Blog, she reviews any place that has a bed and things to do nearby.
