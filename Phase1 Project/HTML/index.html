            Chilled water dropping from the mighty mountains, tearing down into a pit covered with pebbles and sand. 
            Pindrop silence surrounds the area and is distracted by the chirping of birds. 
            Seems like a location in the Alps region of Switzerland, right. 
            But it's in Kerala, in the district of Pathanamthitta which is famed for its scenic nature.

          <h2><u>Legend Behind The Temple</u></h2>
          <img src="image2.jpg" class="pic" width="200px">
  
          <p>
            Every temple has a story to unfold. It is said that Kannagi burnt the whole city of Madurai out of rage when her husband (a merchant)was falsely accused of theft and killed by king Nedunchezhiyan. 
            Then, is believed that Kannagi walked for 14 days reached Kumily in Kerala where now the temple is located and to heaven from there on Pushpaka Vimana, along with Kovalan, her husband. 
            King Chera Chenguttavan, who was inspired by this story, built a temple for undying love and determination. As per the story, Chenguttavan brought stones from the Himalayas to build the temple. 
            The story of Kannagi, later, was narrated to a Tamil poet Illango Adigar by the King. 
            The poet later wrote as a book 'Silapathikaram'(the tale of an Anklet) based on the story of Kannaki and Kovalan.

          <h2><u>unexplored travel destination in Palai</u></h2>
          <img src="image3.jpg" class="pic" width="200px">
  
          <p>
            Places like these cant found on the road map of our village. 
            My grandmother used to tell me the stories of these hills when I was a child. At 77, whenever my grandmother reminiscent her memories it still smells like fresh art. 
            The first sunrise, the promising eventual will happen in these hills. The aurora will invite the entire village into a new day. 
            She travelled with her father in a cycle to watch the fluffy clouds drifted across the clear blue sky. Her memories blessed with the blow of wind. 
            There was no brutality, no betrayal, no self-seeking, no war and also there was no jeopardising pandemic agent. The entire village lived in harmony and purity. 
            Now on a late evening when I was going there my mind smells the calmness of the place. Trying to find the paths I had asked an old man to lead the way. The road was narrower and damaged. 
            A whole group of trees are travelling with us. I can see small houses along the sides of the road. The old man enthusiastically decided to lead the way in the direction where the hills turned into heaven.
